It seems like we both would like to take this project half-way serious. So
lets start a feature list file that we put in github. It will contain
things that we want to do. Here are a few to start with.

1. Read other files besides a csv
2. Allow the deliminter of the file to be specified by user
3. Allow simple Linear Regression
4. Add checks of regression assumptions and issue warning() when they are
violated.
